        <h2>Projects I worked on</h2>
        <p> <h3>Personal Portfolio Website:</h3>
            "I developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. The website
            features an interactive design, responsive layout, and smooth navigation, built using HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. I implemented a contact form that sends emails directly to my inbox using a PHP backend. This
            project helped me improve my front-end development skills and understand the basics of user experience
            design."</p>
        <p><h3>Weather Forecasting App:</h3>
            "I created a weather forecasting app that provides real-time weather updates for any location. Using the
            OpenWeatherMap API, I fetched data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, which were then
            displayed in a user-friendly interface built with React. This project enhanced my knowledge of API
            integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and state management in React."</p>
        <p><h3>Task Management System:</h3> 
            "I developed a task management system to help users organize their daily activities. The system includes
            features like task creation, categorization, due dates, and completion tracking. I used Node.js and Express
            for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and Angular for the front-end interface. This project allowed me
            to practice full-stack development and understand the intricacies of RESTful API design."</p>
            <p><h3>Chat Application:</h3>
                "I built a real-time chat application that supports both private and group conversations. The app was developed using Socket.io for real-time communication, Node.js for the server, and React for the front-end. I implemented features like user authentication, message notifications, and media sharing. This project taught me how to handle real-time data and build scalable applications that can handle multiple users simultaneously."</p>
